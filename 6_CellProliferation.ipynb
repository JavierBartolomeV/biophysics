    "# Stem Cell Proliferation Growth \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In general stem cells undergo a phase of proliferation that expands the population, then they start to differentiate to produce the different types of progeny. Let’s calculate how a population of stem cells grow in time. Lets assume we have an initial number of cells `N` in a population \n",
    "\n",
    "After a given time we have a number of new stem cells `∆N` (number of newly produced cells) during a given time interval, `∆t`, is proportional to the initial  number of cells `N`. (If a population of 20,000 cells produces 1200 new cells in 1 h, a 4-fold bigger population of 80,000 cells of the same type of microorganism will produce 4 times as many, viz. 4800, new cells in 1 h): \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\Delta N}{\\Delta t} \\sim N $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the newly produced cells always add to the population, i.e. N increases steadily, we have to regard time intervals (and accordingly numbers of newly formed cells) that are as small as possible. Mathematically we thus have to deal with infinitesimal increases or differentials: \n",

    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} N}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\sim N $$\n",

    "To get from proportionality  to an equation, a proportionality factor, μ, is introduced. This is the specific growth rate or often termed simply growth rate. Sorting of variables yields: \n",

    "  \n",
    "   If the time that has passed is exactly the average length of the cell cycle of the stem cell population, we can write that in $t = T$ the population has doubled, so $N_0$ has increased to $2 N_0$:\n",
